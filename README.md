# Dicey (Dice-Game)

The idea for this site/game came from a game my wife came up with for our 3 year old grandson. The game involves taking turns in rolling 2 dice or more (depending on which of the five levels are selected) with the aim being to roll a higher score than the other person. Very simple but the real aim of the game is that it gets a 3 year old counting the dots and adding the dice together in his head. Even at 3 he is competitive and so I think he loves adding the numbers up to see who's won.


**The goals of Dicey**

First to have a little fun and second to start teaching mental arithmetic.
